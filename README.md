## **Version 1.0.3**

Fixed: The input PNG and TIFF formats were not being processed.

## **Version 1.0.2**

Completely reworked, optimized version with error handling.

## **Version 1.0.0**

Create BCR and NMO .tga .tif .png textures from Arma 3 CO, NOHQ, SMDI and AS .paa or (.tga, .tif, .png) textures.

If the source is in .paa format, then you should copy the CO, NOHQ, SMDI, AS files into the PAA_Source folder, and if it's already in .tga .tif or .png format, you should copy it to the TGA_Result folder.

The conversion with the PAA2PBR.bat file.
